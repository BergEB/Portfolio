# Portfolio
ACS Project Portfolio

This Repository represents a portfolio of my work from September 2019 to June 2020. This portfolio takes the form of a web page which can be found [HERE](https://bergeb.github.io/Portfolio/index.html).

## Overview

#### Home
The home page is exactly what it seems, welcoming whoever visits the page and explaining the purpose of the website.

#### Gallery
The gallery page provides links to Processing sketches I have created. Each was initially writen in Java, using Processing, so some graphical methods are not supported in the JavaScript versions (*clip() method originally used in Defo Java sketch not supported in JavaScript*). I am planning on updating both the TSSprial sketch, and the 3D height mapping in the Terrain sketch, the libraries of the latter I will either have to manually import or forget about all together to reduce clientside interaction.

#### Esotericism
The Esotericism page is the "Deep Thoughts" section of the website. Here you will find some cryptic and unusually formatted wordplay. *don't think too hard*

#### Eronk
The Eronk page is the "About me" section of the website. On this page you will find information about my experiences with Computer Science, a photo gallery, and an embedding of my twitch stream.
