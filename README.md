This Repository represents a portfolio of my work from September 2019 to June 2020. This portfolio takes the form of a web page which can be found [HERE](https://bergeb.github.io/Portfolio/Pages/home.html).

### Overview

#### Design
Every page in this website shares a theme: thin, sleek lines colored to maximize each element's distinction while maintaining a readable and stylistic color scheme. I used thin, off-white borders in a way which highlights the content within the borders while still maintaining contrast between darker and more neutral colors.
   
The background is made up of 30+ individual processing sketches, which I modified to match the website's color scheme. At first, the background animation would loop indefinitely, but after a fair amount of consideration, I implemented a stopping point. The stopping point helped retain the mesmerizing effect of the animation while creating an exquisite backdrop for users who were doing more than quickly browsing.
   

#### Home Page
The home page is exactly what it seems, welcoming whoever visits the page and explaining the purpose of the website. It may seem like most home and index.html pages are synonymous, but the index(welcome) page is only accessible via direct URL.

#### Gallery (Projects)
The gallery page provides links to Processing sketches I have created. Each was initially writen in Java, using Processing, so some graphics methods are not directly supported in the JavaScript versions. I am planning on implementing the original 3D heightmapping within the Terrain sketch. To do so I will either have to find a way to import the initial camera control library it uses -->([PeasyCam](https://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/))<-- or translate one of my own camera control libraries into JS.

#### Esotericism (Deep Thoughts)
The Esotericism page is the "Deep Thoughts" section of the website. Here you will find some cryptic and unusually formatted wordplay. Pretty cool tho.

#### Eronk (About me)
The Eronk page is the "About me" section of the website. On this page you will find information about my experiences with Computer Science, and a photo gallery.
